# Clone-of-Microsoft-Webpage

I cloned Microsoft's website using HTML and TailwindCSS. Through this project, I gained several insights:
1. I learned how to build a responsive site.
2. I learned how to create a navigation bar.
3. I learned how to implement a carousel.
4. I learned about designing buttons.
